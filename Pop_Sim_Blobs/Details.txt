In this version of the code QuadTree structure has been inplemented purely to only get the food which is in the surrounding area of the blob as determined by it's range.

The value of the food is scaled to the population size so that a larger population will decrease the total energy which is added to the world each frame. No cap on the number of food bits that can be added.
